Starting the Python training script...
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h and are newly initialized: ['masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
